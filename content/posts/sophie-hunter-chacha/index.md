Music is a big part of my life. I have play lists for every mood and occasion that I have built over decades.
I often listen to music while I am reading, writing or programming. The majority of these, of course, are Urdu and Punjabi Classics.
That's what I grew up listening to. However, early enough in my life, I was introduced to the likes of The Beatles, Pink Floyd,
The Eagles and more. This means that my playlists have a significant number of North American and British singers as well.

While I rarely veer from the classics, it is always a treat when you discover a new artist. A few days ago, a friend posted an excerpt
from a song in our Discord Chat. It went something like this:

<!-- vale proselint.Cursing = NO-->
<!-- vale alex.ProfanityLikely = NO-->
{{< center-quote >}}
He said "PCP" I said

"You mean like angel dust?"

"No like primary care physician"

I said "Are you on drugs?

Fuck I look like I'm insured?

I'm getting off this bus!"

<!-- vale proselint.Cursing = YES-->
<!-- vale alex.ProfanityLikely = YES-->

When I asked him where it was from, he linked me to the [lyrics page](https://genius.com/Sophie-hunter-cha-cha-lyrics) for the song.

What ensued was a basically a week of listening to the song non-stop. I now consider myself a fan of [Sophie Hunter](https://www.instagram.com/sophiehunter.mp3/?hl=en)
and her songs have earned their rightful place in the play lists I use to amp myself up.

[_Cha Cha_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YALFdhwe2KI) is a rap song. However, it is part of the newer wave of rap songs that deals with the issues of self, identity and the challenges one faces as they go through their lives. This one seems quite autobiographical, as it recounts Sophie's struggles as a _broke artist_ who is trying to _make it big_, along with her coexisting struggles with mental health issues. The song is full of dark comedy and sardonic wit, that thrills me every time I listen to it. It is a fantastic song and I really wish her all the best as I would love for her to headline a tour as big as Eras one day.

You can purchase the song on [Amazon Music](https://www.amazon.com/music/player/albums/B0DDX419Y3), [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/cha-cha-single/1764316115), and [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/7MV6ANiLZPZ7yJdPoDWT7d).
