Since 1947, the [Bulletin of Atomic Scientists](https://thebulletin.org) has been
the keeper of the [Doomsday Clock](https://thebulletin.org/doomsday-clock/). The
clock is a metaphor for how close humanity is to destroying itself, in terms of
"Minutes to Midnight", with _Midnight_ standing for when the human-made
catastrophe happens. The current setting of the clock represents the collective opinion
of the members of the [Bulletin](https://thebulletin.org).

In its original incarnation in 1947, the clock was a way of representing the
danger of a possible nuclear war as the Cold War was beginning to take shape.
Since then, it has expanded to include Climate Change and Technological
Capabilities like Artificial Intelligence (AI). Honestly, I think it's an
excellent way to visually represent existential threats to humanity.


## Factors Influencing the Doomsday Clock

I am not talking about the Doomsday Clock for naught. However, there is a reason for that long
introduction. But before that, let's look at the last couple of years.
<!-- vale alex.ProfanityMaybe = NO -->
In the past 2 years, there have been major developments worldwide that have created
long term uncertainty and fears. The current state of [nuclear proliferation](https://web.archive.org/web/20250213023857/https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/nuclear-weapons-who-has-what-glance) is unsustainable. Looking at the current conflicts, The Russian Federation, a nuclear power,
has mounted a long term offensive against Ukraine. This has then set in motion a series of events that involve NATO and NATO Allies
many of which have nuclear capabilities. In the Middle East, an ill-advised terrorist attack has provoked an escalation in the ongoing Israeli Genocide in Gaza. This is a major source of instability in the Middle East, even if you ignore [Israeli Nuclear Capabilities](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0096340214555409).

On the Climate Change Catastrophe front, we have seen unprecedented, and steady, rises in temperature over the past two decades
with [2024 marking the first year when the world passed 1.5$^\circ$ Celsius mark considered critical by the Paris Climate Agreement.](https://climate.copernicus.eu/copernicus-2024-first-year-exceed-15degc-above-pre-industrial-level)

{{< image src="./GCH2024_temp_anamolies.png" alt="Global surface air temperature increase ($^\circ$C) above the average for the pre-industrial reference period (1850–1900) for each month from January 1940 to December 2024, plotted as time series for each year. 2024 is shown as a thick red line and 2023 as a thick pink line, while other years are shown with thin lines and shaded according to the decade, from blue (1940s) to red (2020s)." caption="Global surface air temperature increase" >}}

I don't even need to go into the implications of the Artificial Intelligence (AI). I would like to point out that AI definitely has implications in [warfare](https://doi.org/10.1080/00963402.2016.1216672) and [climate change](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/ai-has-environmental-problem-heres-what-world-can-do-about)

I do not want to go into too many details of how the world is teetering at the edge of oblivion. That's only useful for fueling anxiety, not finding solutions. Suffice to say that there are significant and major problems in the world right now, that warrant deeper introspection and quick action.

## A (Relevant) Interlude

At this point, I would like to link to one of my favorite leftist YouTubers [Innuendo Studios/Ian Danskin](https://www.youtube.com/@InnuendoStudios).
Over the past few years, Ian has been publishing targeted deconstruction of the Right-Wing and Fascist rhetoric in his series [The Alt-Right Playbook](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJA_jUddXvY7v0VkYRbANnTnzkA_HMFtQ)

However, a few weeks ago, he published a video titled "The South Bank of The Rubicon", in the same series. Unlike the usual content, this video was a warning and a plea. The video talks about how nobody wants to appear alarmist by saying that the danger is already here. My description will not do justice to the video, so you can watch it yourself.

{{< youtube 0YFdwfNh5vs >}}

The point about calling out the danger too early, for fear of being labeled an alarmist or a conspiracy theorist, is a legitimate fear and a threat to any public figure's credibility. That is a reality of the world we live in. However, _pretending_ the danger is not here yet, does not _mean_ that the danger is not here. As Ian says:

Thus, this puts a _moral_ and _ethical_ responsibility on public bodies to take a stance, own it and sound the alarm.


## The Clock Strikes What?

When the clock was unveiled, it was set to 7 minutes to midnight. This reflected
major concerns at the time regarding nuclear proliferation. Of course, this was also
two years after the [Bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki), the first, and to date only
use of nuclear weapons in an offensive capacity.

Since then, as Wikipedia tells ([and documents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_Clock#Timeline)) it, it has been changed 25 times in
total. It was set forward (indicating greater danger) eighteen times and set backwards
(indicating less danger) 8 times. The farthest it had been was 17 minutes in 1991,
while the closest is 89 seconds, in 2025.

{{< image src="./Doomsday_Clock_graph.svg" alt="A Doomsday Clock graph visualizing time changes over a period. The x-axis represents years or events, while the y-axis displays time close to midnight, marked with labels such as '23:59' and '23:58.' The graph consists of a fluctuating trend line illustrating how the symbolic clock has moved forward or backward over time." caption="Timeline of the changes in the Doomsday Clock">}}

The Bulletin as is evident from the graph above, the until recently, the Bulletin had been thinking in terms
of minutes, not seconds. Until 2017, there were no fractional changes. In 2017, there was a 30-second jump and more recently it's been
counting down seconds. The most recent change, which was announced on January 28th 2025, has moved the clock one second down, from 90 to 89.

If you pay attention, this trend towards smaller and smaller changes started when the dangers impacting us increased exponentially. There were sweeping changes in 2017 onward, that
made it imperative to communicate the danger. When the time came to change the clock in 2017, the clock was already set to 3 minutes to midnight. The situation on the world stage was not getting any better, which meant that the clock had to be set forwards. The Bulletin decided that a 30-second change would be enough to communicate that.

However, on [January 28th, 2025](https://thebulletin.org/2025/01/press-release-doomsday-clock-set-at-89-seconds-to-midnight-closest-ever-to-human-extinction/), The Bulletin decided to set the clock forward by __One Second__. Let me reiterate: The Bulletin set the clock forward from 90 seconds, to 89 seconds. This came eight days after Donald Trump was sworn in as the 47$^{th}$ President of the United States and made several alarming statements in his almost 30 minutes long [inauguration speech](https://web.archive.org/web/20250215173334/https://www.whitehouse.gov/remarks/2025/01/the-inaugural-address/).

In their [public statement](https://web.archive.org/web/20250131023151/https://thebulletin.org/doomsday-clock/2025-statement/), The Bulletin justified this as follows:

> In 2024, humanity edged ever closer to catastrophe. Trends that have deeply concerned the Science and Security Board continued, and despite unmistakable signs of danger, national leaders and their societies have failed to do what is needed to change course. Consequently, we now move the Doomsday Clock from 90 seconds to 89 seconds to midnight—the closest it has ever been to catastrophe[…].

> In setting the Clock one second closer to midnight, we send a stark signal: Because the world is already perilously close to the precipice, a move of even a single second should be taken as an indication of extreme danger and an unmistakable warning that every second of delay in reversing course increases the probability of global disaster.

For all the grandstanding in the report, I found these two passages to be contradictory. Yes, humanity __has__ edged closer to catastrophe. However, a change of __One Second__, does not even give the appearance of the gravitas that the rest of the statement attempts to convey. It feels more like a cop-out than a statement on the current state of affairs.

I understand that The Bulletin, does not want to sound alarmist, but this is a symbol where changes are supposed to matter. A change of one second sends no message other than "We do think there is grave danger, but we are afraid to own that stance." In the [South Bank of The Rubicon](https://youtube.com/v/0YFdwfNh5vs?t=310), Ian made a comment that people that make bold claims about how "this will never happen on our watch", just try to divert the river, rather than turning back or stopping.

## Conclusion

I have to admit that _I_ don't want to sound alarmist either. However, I do understand that someone has to do this, and I am okay with that risk. We have to recognize the dangers facing us today, and be willing to fight them, before the world surely, albeit slowly, turns into a dystopia that will be much worse than the ones imagined so far.
