This is (provisionally) going to be a regular feature where I will post the results
from my puzzle solving from that day. This will mainly feature the puzzles for [Puzzmo](https://www.puzzmo.com/) and
the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/).

## Puzzmo

[Puzzmo](https://www.puzzmo.com) is a new kid on the block. They have been around
just over a year and have made bold strides in introducing both new puzzles
and new spins on older puzzles. At some point, I will review the website but
suffice to say that they are one of the best places to play now. The best part
is that they have a new puzzle every day, and the [Today's Puzzle](https://www.puzzmo.com/today)
is free to solve. If you want access to their archives, you could subscribe to the service, but that's not necessary.

## New York Times

I am not going to waste the space here talking about [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles) and their excellent selection
of puzzles. They have one of the best selection of puzzles, even when they are behind a paywall. I am mostly going
to play the [Spelling Bee](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee/) and the [Mini Crossword](https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/game/mini).

## Today's Puzzling Adventure

### Puzzmo Crossword

Today's puzzle was [Use Your Noodle](https://www.puzzmo.com/puzzle/2025-03-25/crossword) by [_Zhouqin Burnikel_](https://www.puzzmo.com/user/xwc/twinsfan) and edited by the prolific [Will](https://www.puzzmo.com/user/xwc/will-e). It was a standard Midi crossword with 13 √ó 8 dimensions.

This was a clever puzzle with plenty of Asian food references, that forced me to use my noodle in challenging ways. It took me _2 minutes, 43 seconds_ to solve, owing to the abundance of the three-letter words. I found it really fun.

My stats for the puzzle were:

| Metric | Value |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| Points | 4,259 |
| Plonks | 12 |
| Streak | 340 |

### Puzzmo Flipart

[Flipart](https://www.puzzmo.com/puzzle/2025-03-25/flip-art) is an interesting rotation puzzle
where you rotate a bunch of smaller figures in a grid around a central rotation point, to fit all
shapes in a grid without overlap. There's usually more than one Flipart puzzle on the website, including sometimes
a massive one called _Bigart_.

Today's Flipart was a 7 √ó 5 grid. The metrics are:

| Metric | Value | Notes |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Points | 3,153 | _N/A_ |
| Rotations | 17 | Fewest Possible Rotations |
| Time Taken | 0 minutes, 12 seconds | _N/A_ |

According to the website I beat 23 champions.


The Bonus Flipart today was a 7 √ó 5 grid as well. The metrics are:

| Metric | Value | Notes |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Points | 3,053 | _N/A_ |
| Rotations | 15 | Fewest Possible Rotations |
| Time Taken | 0 minutes, 12 seconds | _N/A_ |

According to the website I beat 89 champions.

### Puzzmo Weather Memoku

Weather Memoku is a puzzle that is inspired by Sudoku and Memory. The goal
here is to fill a 6 √ó 6 grid of elements that change based on the weather of the place
you have entered. You can play the so-called _Home_ Memoku based on your current
location, and you can play a randomly selected location in the world with _Global_ Weather Memoku.

My results for today, along with recent forecast is given below:

> ‚ñ£ Memoku 2025-03-26

### NYT Spelling Bee

Today's Spelling Bee was edited by _Sam Ezersky_. The letters in question were
_A_, _L_, _T_, _V_, with _R_ being the central letter.

I had fun playing this, but I did feel out of depth as this was the first time
I was playing it in earnest. I managed to get the Coveted _Queen Bee_ with all
52 words found. However, I have to admit that it took me a while and I used hints for more than
half of them. The graphic below summarized my results:
