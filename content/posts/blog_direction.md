## A new direction for my blog

Hello, dear readers. It has been a while since I last created a post, and I wanted to take a moment to explain why and share my plans for the future.

## Life Happens

There are several reasons for my absence, not the least of which are my commitments to my family and my ongoing PhD studies. Balancing these responsibilities with writing can be challenging, and I appreciate your understanding.

## Overcoming Writer's Block

However, Another major hurdle I've faced is the dreaded `Writer's Block`. For me, it manifests as anxiety about the quality of my writing, spiraling into an interminable mess. I've decided it's time to confront this issue head-on.

## A Promise to Myself and You

This blog post serves as a promise to myself and to you, my dear readers. I commit to making a conscious effort to create a post once every two weeks at least.

## A Mix of Topics

To make regular posting easier, I won't limit myself to a single topic. Expect a mix of personal stories and thoughts, technical posts about projects I've worked on or lived, and updates on various projects I am currently working on.

## Thank You

Thank you, dear reader, whoever and wherever you may be. Your support means the world to me.
